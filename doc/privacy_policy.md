**Privacy Policy for `Any WebManifest`**

This Privacy Policy describes how `Any WebManifest` ("the Extension") collects, uses, and shares information. Please read this policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your information and how we will treat it.

**1. Data We Do Not Collect**

`Any WebManifest` is designed to enhance your browsing experience by programmatically injecting a `<link rel="manifest">` tag into web pages that do not inherently possess a `webmanifest`.

**We explicitly state that this Extension does not collect, store, transmit, or process any user-identifiable information, personal data, browsing history, website content, or any other form of user data whatsoever.**

**2. How Your Data (or lack thereof) is Used**

Since `Any WebManifest` does not collect any user data, there is no data to be used. The Extension operates entirely locally within your browser and its functionality is limited to:

*   **Identifying the absence of a `webmanifest`:** The Extension inspects the current web page's DOM (Document Object Model) to determine if a `<link rel="manifest">` tag is already present.
*   **Injecting a `webmanifest` link:** If no `webmanifest` link is found, the Extension programmatically adds a new `<link rel="manifest" href="data:application/json;base64,xxxxxxx">` tag (or a similar, pre-defined path) to the page's `<head>` section. This action occurs solely within your local browser environment.

**3. Sharing of Your Data**

As no user data is collected by [Your Plugin Name], there is no data to be shared with any third parties.

**4. Data Security**

Given that no user data is collected or stored, there is no personal data to secure. The Extension's operations are confined to your local browser environment.

**5. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
